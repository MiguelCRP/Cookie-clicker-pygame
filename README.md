# Cookie Clicker replication made by young self-taught programming enthusiasts

1. The game is programmed in `python` using the `pygame` module. We're still learning/improving so don't expect much complexity (or readability) in our code.
2. The game is based on the original "Cookie Clicker", made by Orteil and Opti
3. We may add some new features, but all the logic is inspired on the original game
4. If you have any suggestions feel free to contact us and create a pull request

### Disclaimer: Our goal with this project is too learn, improve, provide something cool and enjoyable and have fun. It is not our intention to discredit the creators of Cookie Clicker by any means, therefore if there is any problem regarding legality issues contact us
